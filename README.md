# browser-tab-manager-extension
Firefox* browser extension that allows you to close open tabs and store their URLs to reduce RAM usage of browser while be able to easily restore them without having to add/delete bookmarks

### TODO:

- [ ] Make Close all button work
- [ ] Create actual Icon
- [ ] Move overflow-x scrollbar for long url titles be below title so as to still read
- [ ] Maybe add site's favicon before title (not within span so scrolling doesnt move it)
- [ ] Total UI/UX update
